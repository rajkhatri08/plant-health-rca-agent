## Entries

### 2026-09-24: rules read-back and data/protocol decisions
- **Changed:** docs only. Recorded decisions 33–43 in `docs/decisions.md`. Updated leakage wording and the repo layout in `CLAUDE.md`. Updated leakage wording in `eval/LEAKAGE.md`. Updated splits, onset offsets, budget, keep rule, decline thresholds, warm-up, published-number check and cut-line scoring in `eval/PROTOCOL.md`. Updated the week 0 row in `docs/PLAN.md`. No code.
- **Tests:** none (docs only).
- **Unsure about:** the whole of `data/` is gitignored, so the data manifest must live outside `data/` (for example `dataset/manifest.yaml`) to be in git.
- **Decisions needed:** the exact warm-up value (must be under 10 samples); which published table and variable set the published-number check uses; where the data manifest lives.

### 2026-09-27: week 0 skeleton, converter, manifest, tag map
- **Changed:**
  - **Skeleton:** `app/` (with `agent/prompts/`), `library/`, `ingest/`, `dataset/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`. Also `requirements.txt` (pinned, including transitive dependencies), `pyproject.toml` (pytest config only), and three backstop patterns in `.gitignore`.
  - **Bash deny rules** in `.claude/settings.json` for the sealed folder and the converter. All three were probed and refused without a prompt.
  - **`dataset/manifest.yaml`**, the single source for MD5s, runs per fault and samples per run.
  - **`dataset/rdata_stream.py`**, the streamed reader from decision 47.
  - **`dataset/convert.py`:**
    - The access-log line is written first, before the raw file is opened.
    - Guards; MD5 check; id checks from float64 statistics; fault, run and sample validation before any write.
    - Routing, with a second check at the open write.
    - One report per side, and a manifest snippet.
  - **`ingest/tag_map.yaml` and `library/tags.yaml`**, 52 tags.
  - **CLAUDE.md:** the convert command.
  - **`decisions.md`:** decisions 44–48.
  - Not run: the converter. Raj runs it.
- **Tests:** `pytest -q`, 179 passed, all on a fake repo and synthetic files. They cover:
  - the reader against pyreadr for gzip, bzip2, xz and uncompressed files
  - chunk boundaries, every form of row names, ALTREP columns, and rejection of unsupported types
  - routing for all four files, the guards, and every validation failure
  - reports, the access log (including failed and killed runs), and the dirty-flag scope
  - the crosscheck, and the sentinel never appearing in stdout, stderr, reports or the log
  - the tag files, and the leak scanner, including its own positive and negative cases

  Two real issues were caught while writing the tests. `route()` sent any fault of `fault_free_training` to open data; it now requires fault 0. And a comment in `library/tags.yaml` mentioned "component letters".
- **Unsure about:**
  - The reader has only seen files from pyreadr's writer and my test writer, not from R itself. The `--crosscheck` run on `fault_free_training` is the first real test.
  - Character row names in the big file would make skipping them slow: a Python loop over about 9.6M elements, possibly tens of seconds. It adds no memory.
- **Decisions needed:** analyzer dead time. In week 1, confirm from the published simulator code how an analyzer update is published (is the value at t the sample taken at t − dead time?) and cite it. Until then `library/tags.yaml` carries the nominal 6/6 and 15/15 minutes. The data can't settle it: the step pattern only confirms the update interval, and onsets fall on analyzer update times.

### 2026-09-27: conversion run (Raj)
- **Changed:** ran the four conversions from commit f425808 with a clean tree (`dirty: false`). Filled `download_date`, `terms` and the conversion section in `dataset/manifest.yaml`. `eval/test_access.log` has one line per run.
- **Tests:**
  - The crosscheck against pyreadr on `fault_free_training` printed "identical: yes" (55 columns).
  - Rows: 250,000 / 480,000 / 5,000,000 / 9,600,000, with 500 runs per fault and 500 or 960 samples per run. No non-finite values in any file.
  - Faults 1-15 of `faulty_training` went to `data/`; everything else went to the sealed folder.
  - Outside the repo, the reader was also checked against files written by R 4.3.3 itself: format versions 2 and 3; gzip, bzip2, xz and uncompressed; compact, integer and character row names; compact integer sequences. All matched R's values exactly, which settles the first "Unsure about" in the previous entry.
- **Unsure about:** nothing new.
- **Decisions needed:** nothing new. Analyzer dead time is still open for week 1.
